          Hear Ukrainian voices. <br />
          See Ukrainian life.
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        What we see is what we care about. <br />
        And what we care about, we keep alive. <br />
        Ukrainian culture breathes in lullabies and laughter, <br />
        in resistance and routine, <br />
        in the way light falls on a kitchen table, <br /> or footsteps echo
        through a snow-covered street. <br /> These films are windows. <br />
        They open to joy, <br />
        to sorrow, <br />
        to truth.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>To Ukraine, </strong>
        <br />
        as it was, as it is, as it dreams to be.
      </p>
