        <strong>Hear Ukrainian voices.</strong>

        To see is to feel.
        <br />
        To feel is to connect.

        These films invite you,
        <br />
        to joy,
        <br />
        to sorrow,
        <br />
        to truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>To Ukraine,</strong>
        <br />
        as it was,
        <br />
        as it is,
        <br />
        as it dreams to be.
